## THOUGHTS: <a name="thoughts"></a>

- capitalistic model of exploitation failed
	- no way a CEOs work is 1000x more worth than average workers
- policy needs to be made for the good of the people
- money is a commodity that enables exchanges of goods
	- basic income
	- rewards for productivity
	- rewards for innovation
	- rewards for care
	- rewards for civic duty
	- rewards for study
	- rewards for arts
	- rewards for philosophy
	-> making the world a better place
		- rewards can be used for luxuries
		- basic needs will always be met
			- food
			- water
			- shelter
			- electricity
			- internet
		- automation for humanity not the enrichment of the few
		-> economics for people not the other way around
			- infinite groth is a myth
			- not everyone can be exporting more than they import
- split of power
	- components
		- judicary
		- legislative
		- executive
		- media
	- each to be protected by all others
- representative democracy is not involved enough
- communism seems flawed (maybe?)
- social justice
